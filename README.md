# 🕵️‍♂️ Operation Pegasus: Compromise of The Server Sharkers' Network

## 🎭 Preface: The Chaos Squad

We are a... peculiar trio:

- **Martín "Moe"** – The (disastrous) "leader". A dev who means well but fixes bugs by creating three more. Thinks he’s in control.
- **Santiago "Larry"** – The mediator who breaks things. A QA who swears everything works... until he touches it and it all crashes.
- **Freddy "Curly"** – The mad inventor. A “hardware hacker” who experiments without knowing what he's doing. Sometimes hacks, sometimes sets things on fire.

## 💡 Project Description

> _"Walk among the clouds... literally."_  
> — Slogan for the Cloud Walkers (CW)

## 🎯 Attack Objective

Gain unauthorized access to **secret blueprints** stored in the R&D department, protected by a combination of IDS/IPS, cameras, and restricted access zones.

---

## 🔍 Simulated Scenario

1. **Manolo**, a key employee and horse racing addict, uses his corporate computer to access betting websites.
2. A **passive investigation** is performed on Manolo: habits, online activity, interests.
3. A **phishing attack** is launched, redirecting him to a fake betting site.
4. Once accessed, a **trojan** is downloaded, granting remote access to his machine.
5. From there, the attacker **pivots** to an **open IP** linked to a surveillance camera.
6. The camera points to the reception desk, where **Lucy**, the secretary, has a **sticky note** with the admin password on her laptop.
7. The password is used to escalate privileges and access the internal network.
8. Eventually, a suspicious folder labeled **“Not here”** is found — but it contains the flying shoe blueprints.

## 🔓 Exploited Vulnerabilities

- Social engineering (custom phishing).
- Malware (remote access trojan).
- Poor physical security (visible password).
- Insecure IoT camera access.
- Weak network segmentation.

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Users are always the weakest link.
- Curiosity (or gambling addiction) can compromise even the most secure systems.
- **Never stick your password on your laptop. NEVER.**

---

## 🤖 Technical Stack

- Metasploit (phishing, trojan, pivoting).
- Nmap (reconnaissance).
- smbclient / enum4linux (enumeration).
- Wireshark / tcpdump (traffic analysis).
- OSINT and social engineering tools.

## 🪪 Credits

Project developed by:

- **Moe (Martín)** – “The dev with motivation but no QA”
- **Larry (Santiago)** – “The tester who breaks everything he touches”
- **Curly (Freddy)** – “The hacker with a screwdriver and a dream”
